## ‚úÖ 1. JUnit Test Cases

We have written different JUnit test cases to verify the core functionalities of the EasyMovies application. These include:

- `testAddMovie()`: Tests addition of a new movie.
- `testDeleteMovie()`: Tests deletion logic for a movie.
- `testUpdateMovieDetails()`: Validates updating a movie‚Äôs info.
- `testSearchMovieByGenre()`: Tests searching logic by genre.
- `testValidateMovieData()`: Ensures input data is valid.

JUnit provides annotations like `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, and `@AfterEach` to manage test flows efficiently.
